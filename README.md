# Distributed Computing Project  

## Overview  

This project explores the use of distributed computing frameworks like Apache Spark and multiprocessing to solve computationally intensive tasks. The tasks demonstrate performance differences between traditional and distributed methods across three problems:  

1. **Edit Distance Computation**  
2. **MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) Inference**  
3. **Flock Movement Simulation**  

## Tasks  

### Task 1: Edit Distance  
Compute the edit distance between sentences using:  
- For-loop  
- Multiprocessing  
- Apache Spark  

### Task 2: MLP Inference  
Run inference on a Multi-Layer Perceptron model using:  
- Non-Spark implementation  
- Apache Spark  

### Task 3: Flock Movement Simulation  
Simulate bird flock movements using:  
- For-loop  
- Apache Spark
